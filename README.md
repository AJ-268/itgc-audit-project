# IT General Controls (ITGC) Audit Project – System Interfaces & Batch Jobs

## Overview
This repository contains a **simulated, undergraduate senior-level capstone project** completed for **CIS 4350 – IT Audit** at Baruch College.

The project involved performing an **Information Technology General Controls (ITGC) audit** of a simulated Alumni/Donor Management System used to manage alumni and donor contributions. The purpose of the engagement was to assess whether appropriate IT controls were designed and operating effectively to protect sensitive donor and alumni data.

All information in this repository is **fully simulated and for educational purposes only**.

### **System Interfaces & Batch Jobs**

**Control Objective**  
To determine whether **data integrity is maintained** for key system interfaces and batch jobs.

**Procedures Performed**
- Obtained an understanding of interface and batch job configurations  
- Evaluated interface and batch job monitoring processes  
- Assessed whether access to interfaces was appropriately restricted  
- Evaluated whether encryption was used for data in transit  
- Reviewed exception handling and batch job execution controls

## Deliverables Included
- Control narrative  
- Audit Program Guide (APG)  
- Workpapers and testing documentation  
- Final audit report  
- Stakeholder presentation

## Individual Contributions
As a member of the project team, my responsibilities included:
- Participating in **walkthroughs and preliminary inquiry** by asking control-related questions of simulated stakeholders  
- Assisting in documenting and refining the **control narrative** based on walkthroughs and inquiry  
- Developing the **Audit Program Guide (APG)** for System Interfaces & Batch Jobs  
- Performing **testing and documentation** using Excel-based worksheets  
- Identifying and documenting **control exceptions and observations** when applicable  
- Contributing to the **final audit report**  
- Designing the **stakeholder presentation** and assisting with presenting **findings and recommendations**  
- Collaborating with team members throughout planning, execution, and reporting phases
